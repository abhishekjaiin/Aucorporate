      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Introduction</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The Supreme Court of India’s ruling in the Tiger Global International II case marks a defining moment in the evolution of India’s international tax jurisprudence. The judgment significantly tightens the interpretation of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), particularly in relation to entities lacking genuine economic substance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        By reaffirming the principle of “substance over form,” the Court has sent a clear message to global investors: treaty benefits cannot be claimed through mere legal incorporation structures or so-called “mailbox companies.”
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Case Background</h2>

        className="rounded-2xl mb-6 w-full h-auto"
      />

      <p className="mb-6">
        Tiger Global International II, a Mauritius-incorporated investment entity ultimately controlled by a US-based fund manager, routed investments into India through a Singapore holding structure. The underlying value of these investments was linked to Flipkart India.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        In 2018, Walmart’s acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart triggered an exit by Tiger Global, resulting in capital gains of approximately USD 1.6 billion.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The dispute centered on whether these gains were taxable in India under the indirect transfer provisions of Section 9 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which taxes offshore transfers where underlying Indian assets exceed 50% of value.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Key Legal Issues</h2>

        className="rounded-2xl mb-6 w-full h-auto"
      />

      <p className="mb-4">
        Tiger Global relied on the India–Mauritius DTAA, asserting:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>Valid Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) as conclusive proof of residence</li>
        <li>Grandfathering protection for investments made between 2011–2015</li>
        <li>Treaty protection shielding capital gains from Indian taxation</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The core issue before the courts was whether treaty benefits could be denied on grounds of lack of substance despite formal compliance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Judicial Evolution</h2>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Authority for Advance Rulings (2020)</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The AAR held that the Mauritius entities were mere conduits lacking commercial substance. It concluded that effective control and decision-making were exercised outside Mauritius, indicating treaty abuse.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Delhi High Court (2024)</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The High Court reversed the AAR ruling, emphasizing that a valid TRC is sufficient to establish residency for treaty purposes. It also acknowledged the long-term investment horizon and upheld treaty protection.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Supreme Court of India (2026) – Civil Appeal No. 262 of 2026</strong>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>1. Tax Exposure for Offshore Structures</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The ruling exposes offshore investment vehicles to retrospective tax scrutiny where underlying substance is weak.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>2. Heightened Substance Requirements</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>Active decision-making functions</li>
        <li>Operational infrastructure</li>
        <li>Commercial rationale beyond tax efficiency</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>3. End of “Mailbox Company” Structures</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Passive holding entities incorporated solely for treaty access without operational substance are effectively disqualified from DTAA protection.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>4. Alignment with Global Tax Standards</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The judgment aligns India with OECD BEPS principles.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The Supreme Court’s ruling in the Tiger Global case marks a decisive shift in India’s tax jurisprudence. It reinforces that treaty protection is not an automatic entitlement but a conditional benefit rooted in genuine economic substance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        For global investors, the message is clear: structures without substance will not survive regulatory scrutiny.
