        India has emerged as one of the most attractive destinations for global business expansion. With a rapidly growing economy, policy reforms, and a large, consumption-driven market, the country offers significant opportunities across sectors.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        For international businesses, entering India is not just about establishing a presence—it is about doing so with clarity, structure, and long-term alignment. A well-informed approach to regulatory, tax, and compliance requirements ensures a smooth and scalable entry into the market.

          The foundation of any successful India entry lies in selecting the appropriate legal structure.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Foreign businesses commonly set up a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides operational control and flexibility. Depending on business objectives, other options such as joint ventures, branch offices, or liaison offices may also be considered.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">The right structure should align with:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li>Business model and operational plans</li>
          <li>Funding strategy and capital requirements</li>

          <li>Long-term growth vision</li>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Making this decision thoughtfully at the outset enables businesses to operate efficiently as they scale.
