      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Introduction</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        India continues to emerge as a preferred destination for global businesses due to its large consumer base, skilled talent pool, and progressively liberalised regulatory environment. Foreign companies seeking to establish a structured and compliant presence in India typically do so by incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary, which is recognised as a separate legal entity under the Companies Act, 2013.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This structure enables foreign investors to operate independently in India while ensuring regulatory compliance under Indian corporate, tax, and foreign exchange laws.

        Step-by-Step Incorporation Process
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The incorporation of a foreign subsidiary in India is a structured regulatory process governed primarily by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). The key steps include:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Digital Signature Certificate (DSC):</strong><br />
          Obtain DSCs for proposed directors to enable secure electronic filing of incorporation documents.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Director Identification Number (DIN):</strong><br />
          Apply for DIN, which is mandatory for all individuals intending to serve as directors in an Indian company.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Name Approval (SPICe+ Part A):</strong><br />
          Reserve the proposed company name through the MCA’s SPICe+ portal, ensuring compliance with naming guidelines.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Drafting of Constitutional Documents:</strong><br />
          Preparation of the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA) outlining the company’s objectives and governance framework.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Incorporation Filing (SPICe+ Part B):</strong><br />
          Submission of the incorporation application along with supporting documents, declarations, and subscriber details.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Certificate of Incorporation (COI):</strong><br />
          Upon verification, the Registrar of Companies (ROC) issues the Certificate of Incorporation, legally establishing the subsidiary in India.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Post-Incorporation Regulatory Compliances
      </h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>FDI Reporting to RBI:</strong><br />
          Mandatory reporting of foreign investment through prescribed forms such as FC-GPR (issue of shares) and FC-TRS (transfer of shares) under India’s FDI regime.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>FEMA Compliance:</strong><br />
          Ensuring adherence to sectoral caps, pricing guidelines, and entry routes (automatic or approval route) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Transfer Pricing Regulations:</strong><br />
          Maintenance of arm’s length pricing documentation for all cross-border transactions between the Indian subsidiary and its foreign parent or group entities.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Mandatory Resident Director Requirement:</strong><br />
          Every Indian company must appoint at least one director who qualifies as a resident in India (minimum 182 days stay in a financial year), in accordance with the Companies Act, 2013.

        Common Challenges Faced by Foreign Companies
      </h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Apostille and Notarisation Requirements:</strong><br />
          Foreign corporate documents must be duly notarised and apostilled in the country of origin, leading to procedural delays.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>DSC Verification Challenges:</strong><br />
          Strict KYC norms may result in delays or rejection of DSC applications if documentation is incomplete or inconsistent.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Indian Mobile Number Requirement:</strong><br />
          MCA compliance filings often require OTP verification linked to an Indian mobile number, creating operational constraints for foreign directors.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Regulatory Familiarity Gaps:</strong><br />
          Limited exposure to Indian corporate, FEMA, and MCA compliance frameworks can result in procedural inefficiencies.
        </li>
      </ul>
