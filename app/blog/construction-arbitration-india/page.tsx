          Construction Arbitration in India: Strategic Lessons from a Recent High Court Ruling
        </h1>

      {/* CONTENT */}
      <section className="mt-8 space-y-4 text-gray-800">

        <p>
          A recent judgment of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in M/s United India Insurance Company vs. M/s Kishan Singh & Others (April 2026) offers important strategic guidance for construction companies navigating disputes in large infrastructure projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond its legal significance, the ruling highlights a practical reality: in complex construction disputes, arbitration outcomes are driven by evidence strategy, not merely contractual entitlement.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">
          Background of the case
        </h2>

        <p>
          The dispute arose from the collapse of a bridge span during execution of a hydro-electric project—an incident that led to severe financial loss and human casualties. The contractor’s claim ran into crores, while the insurer, United India Insurance Company, relied on a surveyor’s report to approve a significantly lower amount.
        </p>

        <p>
          This divergence—common in EPC and infrastructure projects—triggered arbitration.
        </p>

          What the Tribunal Did Differently
        </h2>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>It rejected inflated reconstruction costs and focused on actual loss valuation</li>
          <li>It scrutinized and partially disregarded the surveyor’s findings where they lacked clarity</li>
          <li>It applied proportionality principles under the insurance framework</li>
          <li>It delivered a balanced award—higher than the insurer’s offer, but lower than the contractor’s claim</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The result: a defensible, reasoned award that survived judicial scrutiny at all levels.
        </p>

          The Court’s Position: Arbitration is Final—Almost
        </h2>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>No re-evaluation of evidence: Courts will not re-assess facts or substitute their own interpretation</li>
          <li>“Plausible view” standard: If the arbitrator’s conclusion is reasonable, it stands—even if alternatives exist</li>
          <li>Expert reports are not binding: Surveyor assessments are relevant, but not conclusive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This reflects India’s consistent shift toward arbitration finality and minimal judicial intervention.

          What This Means for Construction Companies
        </h2>

        <p>1. Evidence is Your Strongest Asset</p>
        <p>
          Arbitration outcomes hinge on documentation, technical substantiation, and financial clarity. Claims unsupported by robust evidence are likely to be discounted—even if contractually justified.
        </p>

        <p>2. Don’t Over-Rely on Surveyor Reports</p>
        <p>
          Insurance surveyors’ assessments are often treated as benchmarks—but this case confirms they can be challenged, diluted, or rejected if inconsistencies exist.
        </p>

        <p>3. Valuation Strategy Matters</p>
        <p>
          Tribunals prioritize actual loss and commercial reality over theoretical or inflated claims. Overstated claims may weaken credibility.
        </p>

        <p>4. Arbitration is Not a Second Trial</p>
        <p>
          Once an award is issued, scope for appeal is extremely narrow. Poor preparation at the arbitration stage cannot be corrected later in court.
        </p>

        <p>5. Risk Allocation Must Be Understood Early</p>
        <p>
          Insurance coverage, contract structure, and execution risks must be aligned from the outset to avoid disputes over liability and compensation.

        <p>
          This judgment reinforces a clear message for the construction sector:
        </p>

        <p>
          Arbitration rewards preparation, precision, and credibility—not just contractual claims.
        </p>

        <p>
          As infrastructure projects grow in scale and complexity, companies that integrate legal strategy with project execution will be best positioned to protect value and manage risk effectively.
